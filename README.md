# Sidebar Project

The project was made to learn useContext.

When I have a lot of components, in many cases they need to 'communicate'. Of course I can put everything in App.js and via props sent it down, but practically many times I send data which is unnecessary - the mess is generating.

I had the problem with dealing state values and functionality around the app, useContext is the solution.
